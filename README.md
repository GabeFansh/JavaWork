This repository contains all my past Java work from classes that include.

1. Data Structures and Algorithms: Focus on learning the basics of different data structures with an emphasis on reliablity and speed ( O(n) )
2. Data Algorthms and Computing Theory: Expansion on the work from DSA with more of a focus on learning the inner workings of algorithms and differences in average speed,
   fastest speed, and slowest speed.
3. Operating Systems: Focus on how an Operating System functions. Learning about disk and CPU scheduling and how it primary works on a computer. Learn the basics of network programming through
   creating a projects.


Main Project:
Multiplayer localhosted Sudoku
Using the basics of server and client in Java, and in a group with my teammates, we created a server hosted Sudoku game that allows mutliple clients to enter and view a board and work together
to solve the entire sudoku board. Learned BufferedReader and PrintWriter. Learned how a server and a client communicates with each other to register different commands. Learned the different 
connection protocals and learned what the benefits and drawbacks are, primaryily between UDP and TCP connections.
